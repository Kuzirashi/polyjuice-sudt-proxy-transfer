## Notes

**Important**: Make sure you use provided bytecode in SudtERC20Proxy.bin - it is whitelisted in Nervos Layer 2 and using different bytecode won't work. This is compiled using: solidity0.8.2 using solcjs.

Make sure `ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY` and `SENDER` correspond respectively to ckETH sender private key and sender address. Make sure Sender has CKB on Layer 2 and ckETH on Layer 2. Default accounts should already have some ckETH and CKB on Layer 2.

Make sure `RECEIVER` account exists on Nervos Layer 2 and it has 0 ckETH for testing purposes.
